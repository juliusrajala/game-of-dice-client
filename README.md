# React Typescript Template

This is a somewhat opinionated starter kit for a React Application using Typescript.

I'm a big fan of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and for the most part, would still recommend using CRA to get started with most of your react-application needs.

What this starter template aims to provide is a lightweight alternative without all the bells and whistles attached.

## Usage

Relatively simple usage. The package comes with a few npm scripts to get you started quickly.

After cloning the repository:

### Development
```
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

### Build and serve locally

`npm serve`
